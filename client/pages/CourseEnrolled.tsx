CORE PRINCIPLES:
1. Never Trust, Always Verify
   - Continuous authentication and authorization
   - Identity-based access controls
   - Behavioral analytics for anomaly detection

2. Least Privilege Access
   - Just-in-time access provisioning
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Privilege escalation monitoring

3. Assume Breach
   - Network micro-segmentation
   - Lateral movement prevention
   - Continuous monitoring and logging

IMPLEMENTATION ARCHITECTURE:
- Policy Decision Point (PDP): Central authorization engine
- Policy Enforcement Point (PEP): Network access controls
- Policy Information Point (PIP): Context and risk data
- Identity Provider (IdP): Authentication services

CASE STUDY - APT28 NETWORK INFILTRATION:
Russian state-sponsored group APT28 used spear-phishing to gain initial access, then moved laterally through poorly segmented networks. Zero-trust would have prevented this by:
- Requiring continuous authentication for each resource access
- Micro-segmenting networks to prevent lateral movement
- Monitoring all network traffic for anomalies`,
